# Terms in video need to be explained:

## what is the instructions "STO" &"LOD"?
### The instructions "STO" and "LOD" are commonly associated with assembly language programming, and their exact meaning depends on the specific instruction set architecture (ISA) or processor architecture being used. These mnemonics are often used to represent storage (STO) and load (LOD) operations, respectively, but the actual usage may vary between different assembly languages.
### STO (Store) Instruction:
#### The "STO" instruction is typically used to store a value from a register or memory location to another memory location. It is part of the data movement category of instructions.
##### STO R1, [MemoryLocation]

### LOD (Load) Instruction:
#### The "LOD" instruction is generally used to load a value from a memory location into a register. It is also part of the data movement category of instructions.
##### LOD [MemoryLocation], R2


## 1. Layout in Memory:
## Layout in memory refers to how data and instructions are organized and stored in a computer's memory. Memory is typically organized into different regions, each serving a specific purpose.
### The memory layout varies between different operating systems and processor architectures.

## 2. Flash:
### Flash typically refers to a type of non-volatile memory technology commonly used for storing firmware, software, and other data in embedded systems. Flash memory has the advantage of being rewritable, allowing for updates to firmware or software without requiring physical replacement of components.
### Flash memory is a critical component in many embedded systems, providing a balance between non-volatility, rewritability, and cost-effectiveness. The layout within flash memory depends on the organization of the firmware, storage requirements, and the specific design of the embedded system.

### In summary, "layout in memory" refers to the organization of data and instructions in a computer's memory, while "flash" generally refers to a type of non-volatile memory technology used for storing firmware, software, and other data in embedded systems.

## Linker 
### A linker is a software utility that plays a crucial role in the process of converting source code into an executable program. Its primary function is to combine multiple object files generated by the compiler into a single executable file. The linker resolves symbols, establishes addresses for variables and functions, and ensures that all the necessary components are properly connected.


# Summary:

## Introduction to Computing Systems
### Computing systems encompass both hardware and software components working collaboratively. The central processing unit (CPU) serves as the brain, executing instructions. Memory provides fast, temporary storage, while storage devices offer long-term, persistent storage. Input/output devices enable interaction. Understanding the synergy between hardware and software is crucial for effective programming and system design.

## Buses: Communication Pathways
### Buses are communication pathways within a computer system. They include:
### Address Bus: Specifies the memory location.
### Data Bus: Transfers data between components.
### Control Bus: Manages control signals.
### Buses facilitate the exchange of information between the CPU, memory, and peripherals, forming a crucial communication infrastructure.

## Languages of Microprocessor
### Microprocessors understand machine language and assembly language:
### Machine Language: Binary code directly executable by the CPU.
### Assembly Language: Mnemonics and symbols representing machine code instructions.
### Understanding these languages is fundamental for low-level programming.

## Assembly Language
### Assembly language is a low-level programming language using mnemonics and symbols to represent machine code instructions. It provides a human-readable representation of machine language, allowing for more manageable programming.

### Advantages & Disadvantages of Assembly
### Advantages:
#### Control Over Hardware: Fine-grained control over hardware resources.
#### Efficiency: Direct manipulation of hardware for optimized code.
#### Specificity to Architecture: Tailored for a particular processor architecture.
#### Low-level Optimization: Opportunities for manual optimization.
### Disadvantages:
#### Steep Learning Curve: Requires understanding of hardware details.
#### Complexity: Code can be intricate and harder to read.
#### Portability Issues: Not easily portable across different architectures.
#### Time-Consuming and Error-Prone: Manual optimization can be time-intensive and error-prone.
#### Decreased Productivity: Development can be slower compared to higher-level languages.

## Building Process:
### Preprocessing: Expand macros, include header files.
#### -Toolchain-
### Compilation: Translate source code into object files.
### Assembling (optional): Convert assembly code into object code.
### Linking: Combine object files, resolve symbols, and generate the final executable
